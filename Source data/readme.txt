Our analysis covers 161 countries, representing 96% of the global population and 93% of the global GDP in 2010 (for example, we excluded countries with missing historical data of mean years of schooling).
We obtained the SSP1-3 data of population (all, male and female), life expectancy at birth (male & female), and mean years of schooling by broad age (15+) in the past (1970-2010) and future (2015-2100) from the Wittgenstein Centre (WIC) for Demography and Global Human Capital (http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/wcde-v2/). We request the data for SSP4-5 from IIASA.
While estimates of life expectancy at birth are available every five years, we interpret them as the measurements for the later year (e.g., life expectancy at birth in 2020-2025 would indicate life expectancy at birth in 2025). GDP per capita data are from Jesus Crespo Cuaresma's research Income projections for climate change research: A framework based on human capital dynamics., and we applied OLS regression extrapolation to estimate the missing data for 25 countries with missing data.
